# CBR Multi Service Profile

An end-to-end example that uses the module's default variable values. This example uses the IBM Cloud Provider to automate the following infrastructure::

 - Create two zones for context-based restrictions.
 - Create a rule for context-based restrictions that uses the zone and attaches a list of service to it.
