You can integrate Terraform IBM Modules (TIM) to extend functionality and design a solution tailored to your environment and operations needs. These modules offer reusable, customizable elements that follow IBM Cloud's recommended practices. You can access the [source code and documentation](https://github.com/terraform-ibm-modules/terraform-ibm-cbr) and use it to extend your current architecture or create new solutions.\n\n\n💡 This Terraform-based automation is part of a broader suite of IBM-maintained Infrastructure as Code (IaC) asset collection, each following the naming pattern \"Cloud automation for *servicename*\" and focusing on single IBM Cloud service. These single-service deployable architectures can be used on their own to streamline and automate service deployments through an [IaC approach](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-understanding-projects), or assembled together into a broader [automated IaC stack](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-config-stack) to automate the deployment of an end-to-end solution architecture.",
